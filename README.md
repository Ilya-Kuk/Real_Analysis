Projects from Real Analysis
The first is Baire's Theorem
  Asking my professor which project would be best for a student pursuing a higher-level degree than Bachelor's in Math. He returned with this project from our textbook: Understanding Analysis by Stephen Abbott. I worked on this (group) project alone, and completed it in its' entirity, start to finish.
  Another project was required the following semester. I did by far most of hte heavily lifting and all of the coding to prove the integral representation of the Gamma Function.
